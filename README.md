# Property-Investment-ROI-Analysis
Data and Visual Analytics (CSE6242) as part of Georgia Tech Master of Science in Analytics degree.

## Project Purpose
How can you select properties that maximize return on investment (ROI) when investing in
real estate? We answered this by building an algorithm which determines ROI based on
user-selected features. We combined real estate listings, historical home
appreciation/depreciation values, data enrichment algorithms, and external resources to
calculate ROI for people interested in real estate investing. All of this is packaged in a clean
user interface, enabling users to explore potential investments in an online interactive tool.
